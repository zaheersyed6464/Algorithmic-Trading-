# Algorithmic-Trading-
Algorithmic Trading means using algorithms in buying and  selling decisions in the financial market. In an algorithmic  trading strategy, a set of predefined rules are used to determine  when to buy a financial instrument and when to sell it.
In this section, I will implement an Algorithm Trading strategy 
known as the momentum strategy on stock price data using 
Python. In the momentum strategy, we buy the stocks when the 
momentum is positive and sell the stocks when the momentum 
is negative.
So let’s import the necessary Python libraries and collect the 
stock price data of Apple using the yfinance API:
To use this, you need to install it by using the pip command in 
your terminal or command prompt as mentioned below:
• pip install yfinance
